Key Changes and Explanations:

Features Section:

Added "Scoreboard" as a core feature.
Added bullet points under "Scoreboard" to clarify:
Name Submission: Explaining how players submit their names with their scores.
Persistent Scoreboard: Highlighting that scores are saved beyond the current game session.
Pagination: Letting users know they can navigate through many scores.
Current Player Highlighting: This ensures that when the player submits their score, it is easier to find them.
How to Play Section:

Added step 6 "Submit your score", informing players to submit their name to save their score.
Game Mechanics Section:

Added a "Score saving" point that explaines when the scores are saved.
Added a "Scoreboard" point that indicates the presense of a scoreboard.
Added a "Score submission" point that states the player needs to submit a name first.
Added a "Scoreboard Ranking" point to show how the scores will be ordered.
Added a "Scoreboard pagination" point to show that the scores will be paginated.
Future Improvements

Added "Add sound effects".
Why These Changes Are Important:

Accuracy: The previous README didn't mention the scoreboard or name submission at all. The updated version accurately reflects these new functionalities.
Clarity: The use of bullet points and clear descriptions makes it much easier for someone new to the project to understand how the scoring system works.
User Experience: By explaining the scoreboard features (persistence, pagination), you're setting expectations for the players and making the game more appealing.
Completeness: The readme provides all the necessary information to get started and understand all the game's features.
This updated README.md is a much better representation of your game's current state. Remember to replace the placeholder text [MIT License] with a link to your actual license file if you have one!
